# Planning with Files

Work like Manus: Use persistent markdown files as your "working memory on disk."

## Quick Start

Before ANY complex task:

1. **Create `task_plan.md`** — Use templates/task_plan.md as reference
2. **Create `findings.md`** — Use templates/findings.md as reference
3. **Create `progress.md`** — Use templates/progress.md as reference
4. **Re-read plan before decisions** — Refreshes goals in attention window
5. **Update after each phase** — Mark complete, log errors

## The Core Pattern

```
Context Window = RAM (volatile, limited)
Filesystem = Disk (persistent, unlimited)

→ Anything important gets written to disk.
```

## File Purposes

| File | Purpose | When to Update |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `task_plan.md` | Phases, progress, decisions | After each phase |
| `findings.md` | Research, discoveries | After ANY discovery |
| `progress.md` | Session log, test results | Throughout session |

## Critical Rules

### 1. Create Plan First
Never start a complex task without `task_plan.md`. Non-negotiable.

### 2. The 2-Action Rule
> "After every 2 view/browser/search operations, IMMEDIATELY save key findings to text files."

This prevents visual/multimodal information from being lost.

### 3. Read Before Decide
Before major decisions, read the plan file. This keeps goals in your attention window.

### 4. Update After Act
After completing any phase:
- Mark phase status: `in_progress` → `complete`
- Log any errors encountered
- Note files created/modified

### 5. Log ALL Errors
Every error goes in the plan file. This builds knowledge and prevents repetition.

### 6. Never Repeat Failures
Track what you tried. Mutate the approach.

## The 3-Strike Error Protocol

```
ATTEMPT 1: Diagnose & Fix
ATTEMPT 2: Alternative Approach
ATTEMPT 3: Broader Rethink
AFTER 3 FAILURES: Escalate to User
```

## When to Use This Pattern

**Use for:**
- Multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
- Research tasks
- Building/creating projects
- Tasks spanning many tool calls

**Skip for:**
- Simple questions
- Single-file edits
- Quick lookups

## Templates

- templates/task_plan.md — Phase tracking
- templates/findings.md — Research storage
- templates/progress.md — Session logging

## Scripts

- scripts/init-session.sh — Initialize all planning files
- scripts/check-complete.sh — Verify all phases complete
- scripts/session-catchup.py — Recover context from previous session
